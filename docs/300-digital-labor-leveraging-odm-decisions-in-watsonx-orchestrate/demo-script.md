<summary>Introduction</summary>

Today we’ll see how IBM watsonx Orchestrate can be used to enhance call center agent productivity, increase compliance with an organization's business procedures, and reduce risk of inconsistency in the decision making process.

Using a customer service scenario, we’ll see how to use watsonx Orchestrate to easily create a 'return validation' skill from an existing IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM) application. Then, we’ll see how the built-in skill flow capability can be used to sequence several skills into a single activity.

We’re using a customer service example, but the same pattern can be used to leverage any existing deployed decision services across your enterprise.

Let’s get started!

<summary>1 - Reviewing the Operational Decision Manager decision</summary>

<br/>

| **1.1** | **Introduce the customer service decision** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | FocusCorp uses Operational Decision Manager (ODM) as a backend application to automatically validate and approve return requests from customers.<br/><br/> The company now wants to enable all call center agents to directly access the decision output so they can determine immediately whether a return is approved while on the phone with a customer. <br/>Before seeing how to create such a skill in watsonx Orchestrate, let’s look at the existing application in ODM. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | Show the ODM Business Console screen that was opened during the demo preparation. Select **Enterprise LDAP** (1), enter the Username **cp4admin** (2), enter the **password** (3) you copied in your notebook, and click **Log in** (4). <inline-notification text="The Decision Center console will start from the last page you were in when you left during your last connection."></inline-notification> <img src="images/1-1-1.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2 | Click the **LIBRARY** tab. <br/> <img src="images/1-1-2.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | The return policy is managed in ODM by FocusCorp's retail business team, using a dedicated business console called Decision Center. Let’s see how the return policy is implemented in ODM. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.3 | Click the **Customer Service** decision service. <br/> <img src="images/1-1-3.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.4 | Click the **main** branch. <br/> <img src="images/1-1-4.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.5 | Click the **Decision Artifacts** tab, if you are not already on that tab. <br/> <img src="images/1-1-5.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.6 | Click the **X** to remove any decision artifact filters (if any). <br/> <img src="images/1-1-6.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.7 | Click **Main customer service flow**. <br/> <img src="images/1-1-7.png" width="800" /> |

<br/>

| **1.2** | **Provide an overview of the decision service** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | The return validation policy is composed of rule artifacts including ruleflows, decision tables and business rules. <br/><br/> The main ruleflow is the backbone of the decision service. It synchronizes a variety of rules that cover fraud detection, warranty validation, return policy and refund conditions. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | Click the **Compute refund** box (1) and then the **Refund flow** link (2). <br/> <img src="images/1-2-1.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Let’s look at one of the decision artifacts. The ‘Shipping fee’ decision table defines the fixed return fee depending on the location of the customer and the type of item being returned. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | Click the **Estimate shipping fee** box (1) and then the **Shipping fee** link (2) to open the decision table. <br/> <img src="images/1-2-2.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Each row of the table corresponds to a specific business rule that can also be seen in natural language. In this rule, the return fee for grocery items in the United States is $15. A message is also added to the response to document the decision. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.3 | Hover your cursor over the header of row 4 to display the 'grocery' business rule. <br/> <img src="images/1-2-3.png" width="800" />  <br/> <img src="images/1-2-3bis.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.4 | Click **Main customer service flow**. <br/> <img src="images/1-2-4.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | This decision service is deployed in a production environment and is invoked by FocusCorp's enterprise applications. Let’s look at the deployment environment. |

<br/>

| **1.3** | **Introduce the production Rule Execution Server** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | The ODM Rule Execution Server is a console to monitor rule applications deployed on a given server. From this console, the rule administrator can test a rule application, trace its usage, run diagnostics, and access execution traces when required. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.3.1 | Show the ODM **Rule Execution Server** screen that was opened during the demo preparation. <br/> <img src="images/1-3-1.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.3.2 | Click the **Explorer** tab. <br/> <img src="images/1-3-2.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Two RuleApps are deployed in this production environment. The 'Customer Service' RuleApp manages the return policy we just looked at in the Decision Center. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.3.3 | Click the **FocusCorp_CustomerService** RuleApp. <br/> <img src="images/1-3-3.png" width="800" /> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.3.4 | Click the **FocusCorp_Customer_Service** Ruleset. <br/> <img src="images/1-3-4.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | The customer service application has one ruleset with two input parameters -- the customer and the purchase to be returned. Both the decision service and the ruleset it contains are versioned. At execution time, a user can decide to use a specific version, or the latest deployed version of the RuleApp. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.3.5 | Point out and explain the **FocusCorp_Customer_Service** ruleset. The output parameter (1), the return decision (2) and the versioning(3). <br/> <img src="images/1-3-5.png" width="800" /> |
| **Narration** | Let’s now see how to leverage these deployed decisions using watsonx Orchestrate to make these return decisions visible to call center agents. |

<summary>Summary</summary>

In this demo, we saw how a company uses IBM watsonx Orchestrate to leverage and expose existing ODM Decision Services in new ways. 

We used the Discovery Service to create a new skill that invokes rule-based decisions manged by ODM. We then created a skill flow that orchestrates a sequence of skills, mapping their respective inputs and outputs automatically. Finally, we used watsonx Orchestrate NLP to invoke this skill flow using a chat interface.

Thank you for attending today’s presentation.
